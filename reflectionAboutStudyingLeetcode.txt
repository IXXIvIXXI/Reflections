When I was studying for Amazon OA, I tried to finish "Top 50 Amazon Questions" problem set in a week(I have done maybe about 7 before). I did 42/50 at the end because some problems like 2281. Sum of Total Strength of Wizards are extremly hard for me to understand the approach and I don't think I understand the approach rn tbh. Therefore it's not very productive so there must be something wrong with my study plan and I need to make some change. Hopefully these changes I made maybe helpful.

1. Quality more than quantity!
Instead of doing as many problems as possible, spending more time on each problem and write down the thinking process of each algorithm and some problems I also need to do them again!

2. Choose appropriate difficulty level
Instead of doing hardest problems from coding interview, focus on medium and harder problems first.

3. Right mindset
Getting a job is a long-term goal and the good thing is I still have some time since I'm junior and I have done about 220 LC so far. If I can't one for next summer, just keep practing and I believe I'll be great next year!
